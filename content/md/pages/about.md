## Wout

I'm Wout Neirynck, I'm born in 1976 and ever since I saw my first computer, I wanted
to be a software developer.  I've been a full-stack developer since 1999.  I founded
my [first software company, DN](https:/www.d-n.be) in 2004, together with a friend.  As
the "technical partner" of the company, I was **responsible for research, technological
decisions and high-level architectural decisions**.  So you might say I have some
experience in developing software.  We sold the company in 2023 and since then I've
been focusing on developing [MonkeyCI](https://monkeyci.com), a "next generation"
CI/CD pipeline tool.  Check it out!

DN built bespoke software for other companies, but during the years I became more and
more **interested in the process of building software itself**.  I'm a big fan of
[TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/TDD), to me still the "least bad" way of writing code.
I've been doing it for 20 years now, and I still love it.  About a decade ago, I
discovered [Clojure](https://clojure.org), and I've been working in it ever since
(next to a lot of Java and some C# code).  I've always liked Lisp, and **Clojure is a
Java-based Lisp variant**.  I love the clean, simple syntax and the functional nature,
which, in my view, results in more stable software.

## Monkey Projects

Monkey Projects was founded in 2009 as a way to better handle the different needs
my business partner and I had at the time.  Since I sold DN, it has become my main
company and is now responsible for developing the [MonkeyCI application](https://monkeyci.com).
