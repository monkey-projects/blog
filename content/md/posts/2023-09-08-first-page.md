Hi and welcome to the first post of the Monkey Projects development blog!  Glad
to see you here, and expect much more to come.  After almost a quarter century
of building software for others, I've decided to move on to a new project and I
want to share that experience with the world.  And since I've built up a lot of
experience in the past, I think this future experience will benefit from.  And
so will you, I think!

So what can you expect here?  I'll be writing about:

 - Test-driven development
 - Functional programming
 - [Clojure](https://clojure.org) stuff
 - The process of developing libraries and applications

And perhaps some random stuff as well!
